# PaperizeHacks
Tips, hacks and short scripts that can be useful when working with Paperize.

Improvised videos of how to use these scripts are found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5sq4vtv3sTHZ_VHDRJQAGXGRYOWGbQw1. Note that some function names have changed since the videos were recorded. New videos will be posted some time. I also hope to provide better documentation soon.

Currently available hacks:

* **generateBacksides**: Used for generating pages with alternating fronts and backs. Allows mirroring position of backsides, making it work with printers flipping the paper over the long or short side when printing double-sided.
* **translate**: Used when you have translation of components. If naming column headers in the style of "titleDe", this function picks out the translated columns instead of the original ones (in this case using the language code "De" for German).
* **merge**: Allows combining content from multiple sheets into a single sheet. A typical use case is different types of cards, where you want to manage data for (say) items separately from (say) spells, but still want Paperize to use a single component template for printing them all.

Feel free to use the issue queue for support, feature requests, bug reports and whatnot.
